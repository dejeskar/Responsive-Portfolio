                <h5 class="myname">My name is Karla. I was born in Mexico and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin ( Go Packers!). I have one older
                    brother and a younger sister. I love sports,music and anything that is hands on. My hobbies consist of
                    designing and making clothe to riding horses and biking for hours. I dont like routines and when I do
                    plan my week I tend to have add-ons to my schedule.

                    <div>My Dream carrer when I was a little girl was to become a ballerina and dance on cute tutus for ever.
                        As I got older and for the simple fact that my family was too poor to put me in ballet classes, I
                        thought myself how to do everything I enjoyed including music</div>
